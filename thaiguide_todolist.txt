TravelGuide to Do
1. determine what elements are needed in the json file
note: see detailview story board
add:

Name
Name in Thai
phone
imageName
location lat
location long
___
note: use this code to covert string to float
let numberFormatter = NSNumberFormatter()
let number = numberFormatter.numberFromString("15.5")
let numberFloatValue = number.floatValue

println("number is \(numberFloatValue)")
____
show in savelist: bool

moreImagesName as a cat cat variable from itemname selected and number

NOTE: morephotoVC imagename is set up the itemName in the json file. Need to have images of the same name

url to youtube videos as string-
note: urls can be call from two separate json 1. local url    2. remote url. use two tableviews in the same view?


2 urls for now : 1. getting there 2. while there ( spoiler alert)
optional videos : around there ( video of the neighborhood-what you should check out while there : places to shop, restaurants, interesting /historical sites, more stuff that normal tourist wont know about)

option 1: index selected value ( var to save) to be added to saveItem on clickbutton
option 2: save all above variables into a "saveitem_array" -->key


2. determine how data for "ClickSaveItem" to list
note: using same code as in the to do list -make and delete ( see youtube video) and sample code todoapp.xcodeproj
